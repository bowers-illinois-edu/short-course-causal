	Abstract = {The familiar logit and probit models provide convenient
		  settings for many binary response applications, but a
		  larger class of link functions may be occasionally
		  desirable. Two parametric families of link functions are
		  investigated: the Gosset link based on the Student t latent
		  variable model with the degrees of freedom parameter
		  controlling the tail behavior, and the Pregibon link based
		  on the (generalized) Tukey ?? family, with two shape
		  parameters controlling skewness and tail behavior. Both
		  Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods for estimation and
		  inference are explored, compared and contrasted. In
		  applications, like the propensity score matching problem
		  discussed below, where it is critical to have accurate
		  estimates of the conditional probabilities, we find that
		  misspecification of the link function can create serious
		  bias. Bayesian point estimation via MCMC performs quite
		  competitively with MLE methods; however nominal coverage of
		  Bayes credible regions is somewhat more problematic. ??

	Abstract = {An instrument or instrumental variable manipulates a
		  treatment and affects the outcome only indirectly through
		  its manipulation of the treatment. For instance,
		  encouragement to exercise might increase cardiovascular
		  fitness, but only indirectly to the extent that it
		  increases exercise. If instrument levels are randomly
		  assigned to individuals, then the instrument may permit
		  consistent estimation of the effects caused by the
		  treatment, even though the treatment assignment itself is
		  far from random. For instance, one can conduct a randomized
		  experiment assigning some subjects to 'encouragement to
		  exercise' and others to 'no encouragement' but, for reasons
		  of habit or taste, some subjects will not exercise when
		  encouraged and others will exercise without encouragement;
		  none-the-less, such an instrument aids in estimating the
		  effect of exercise. Instruments that are weak, i.e.
		  instruments that have only a slight effect on the
		  treatment, present inferential problems. We evaluate a
		  recent proposal for permutation inference with an
		  instrumental variable in four ways: using Angrist and
		  Krueger's data on the effects of education on earnings
		  using quarter of birth as an instrument, following Bound,
		  Jaeger and Baker in using simulated independent
		  observations in place of the instrument in Angrist and
		  Krueger's data, using entirely simulated data in which
		  correct answers are known and finally using statistical
		  theory to show that only permutation inferences maintain
		  correct coverage rates. The permutation inferences perform
		  well in both easy and hard cases, with weak instruments, as
		  well as with long-tailed responses.},
