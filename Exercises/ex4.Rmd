 1. In `class3.Rmd` we created a match on a propensity score using only two
 covariates. Can you improve on this design by adding other covariates or
 functions of them? (You can improve on a design by (a) making it more
 consistent with some known standard of good design (like increasing the
 $p$-value in `xBalance`) and/or (b) making it easier to defend in substantive
 terms (i.e. the comparisons exclude relevant alternative explanations) and/or
 (c) making it easier to detect signal from noise (i.e.  increasing statistical
 power by not dropping so many observations).

OR

2. Improve your own matched design.
