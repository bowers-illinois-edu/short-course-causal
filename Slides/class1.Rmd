\subsection*{Topics:}

\paragraph*{How to use optimal, full matching to produce a matched-research
design?} \vspace{-1.5em} Multivariate optimal matching review using \texttt{optmatch}  in R:
producing matched research designs using matching on scalars, propensity
scores, and Mahalanobis distances.

\paragraph*{How to reason about whether we have a good matched research design?}
Multivariate balance assessment using null hypothesis testing using the
\texttt{RItools} package for R (and perhaps also using equivalence testing).

\paragraph*{How to customize and focus the matched research design creation?}
Multivariate optimal matching; calipers; penalties; combining scores


\paragraph*{How to estimate the ATE  and test hypotheses about causal effects
given a matched research design?} Estimating ATE and Std Errors from Matched
Designs using the Block Randomized Experiment as an Analogy.
